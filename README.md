## Hello! I'm Jainish PrajapatiðŸ‘‹

<h7>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from [Government Engineering College, Gandhinagar](http://gecg28.ac.in), and have completed a Diploma in Computer Engineering from [Government Polytechnic, Ahmedabad](http://gpahmedabad.ac.in). I am specialized in building APIs using Java (Spring Boot) and developing backends with Python (Flask). I also have a good understanding of statistical machine learning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), which helps in analyzing data and gaining insights. I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to gain new opportunities in the field of Computer Engineering.
